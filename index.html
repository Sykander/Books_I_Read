              <h1>The Seer and the Sword</h1>
              <p>The Seer and the Sword is a fantasy adventure book written by Victoria Hanley.</p>
              <p>The story is split between the perspective of a young princess and an outsider young boy who both live in the same castle, the story of course progresses to them eventually meeting and working together to overcome the antagonist of the story.</p>
              <p>The storyline is fairly generic but the characterisation and writing style are very immersive and can keep you engaged very well.</p>

              <h1>Mortal Engines</h1>
              <p>Mortal Engines was written by Philip Reeves in 2001.</p>
              <p>It's set in a far off dystopian future where all resources on the earth have run out and cities roam the land consuming smaller towns and villages to survive.</p>
              <p>Overall, the story is gripping from the get go simply from the premise to the story, it progresses along in an incredibly unique and vibrant world complete with intrigue and action.</p>

              <h1>The Night Watch</h1>
              <p>The Night Watch is a short book, now a series, written by Sergei Lukyanenko.</p>
              <p>It follows the life of a fairly young 'other', a being with mystic powers which ultimately don't help his life out in much of a way. As an other it's his responsibility to keep the Night Watch where he protects regular citizens from the dangers of others.</p>
              <p>The story blurs the lines between good and evil whilst also casually mocking the concept of an absolute good or an absolute evil, it's very gritty and somehow realistic with fantasy elements. The main character comes across as just a regular person a bit tired with a job they know they can't just leave.</p>

              <h1>Across the Nightingale Floor</h1>
              <p>Across the Nightingale Floor is the first in a four part series written by Lian Hearn in 2002.</p>
              <p>The story is set in Feudal Japan, where a young boy is the only survivor or a raid on his village, he is taken in by a wandered and eventually raised as a ninja.</p>
              <p>Although the concept is a bit cliched, the focus of the book isn't on the story but on the self development and determination of the main character. He has to find and fight for his own morals and code of ethics while the whole world works against him.</p>

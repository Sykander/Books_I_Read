              <h1>The Wheel of Time</h1>
              <p>The Wheel of Time is a fantasy series written James Oliver Rigby under the pen-name Robert Jordan, he began writing it in 1984 and was left unfinished when James died in 2007.</p>
              <p>He entrusted the upcoming writer Brandon Sanderson with his notes to finish the series after his death. </p>
              <p>The story follows many characters across various continents and cultures, it creates a realistic and human world with elements of magic and mythology. Overall, I enjoyed the series for the nuance and foreshadowing of the story as well as some of the thrilling moments.</p>
              <p>HBO is currently working on a tv adaption of The Wheel of Time to fill the viewing gap after they're done with Game of Thrones.</p>
              <p>If you enjoy books like Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings then The Wheel of Time is a must read, for it's immersive world and gripping plotlines. The character progression is also amazing with both main and side characters developing and progressing as human beings within their normal lives.</p>

              <h1>Berserk</h1>
              <p>Berserk is a dark fantasy horror written by Kentaro Miura set in a medieval european-esque continent. He began drawing Berserk in 1988 and it is still being published to this day.</p>
              <p>The story follows a band of mercenaries for hire fighting in the Hundred-Years war, their leader Griffith has high aspirations and the story follows both him and his followers Guts journey to ruling the kingdom.</p>
              <p>Overall I would say this is an amazing series for two reasons: the art is absolutely phenomenal, with incredible detail and emotion in every frame; and secondly because the characterisation of devlopment of the cast. </p>
              <p>The story also blurs the lines between right and wrong, and the protagonist, Guts, is hardly someone to aspire towards. He pushes the boundaries of characterisation beyond a regular Anti-hero into something beyond. Guts is both an unbelievably determined person but also an incredibly broken one.</p>

                  <h1>The Seer and the Sword</h1>
                  <p>The Seer and the Sword is a fantasy adventure book written by Victoria Hanley.</p>
                  <p>The story is split between the perspective of a young princess and an outsider young boy who both live in the same castle, the story of course progresses to them eventually meeting and working together to overcome the antagonist of the story.</p>
                  <p>The storyline is fairly generic but the characterisation and writing style are very immersive and can keep you engaged very well.</p>

              <h1>Mortal Engines</h1>
              <p>Mortal Engines was written by Philip Reeves in 2001.</p>
              <p>It's set in a far off dystopian future where all resources on the earth have run out and cities roam the land consuming smaller towns and villages to survive.</p>
              <p>Overall, the story is gripping from the get go simply from the premise to the story, it progresses along in an incredibly unique and vibrant world complete with intrigue and action.</p>

                  <h1>The Night Watch</h1>
                  <p>The Night Watch is a short book, now a series, written by Sergei Lukyanenko.</p>
                  <p>It follows the life of a fairly young 'other', a being with mystic powers which ultimately don't help his life out in much of a way. As an other it's his responsibility to keep the Night Watch where he protects regular citizens from the dangers of others.</p>
                  <p>The story blurs the lines between good and evil whilst also casually mocking the concept of an absolute good or an absolute evil, it's very gritty and somehow realistic with fantasy elements. The main character comes across as just a regular person a bit tired with a job they know they can't just leave.</p>

              <h1>Across the Nightingale Floor</h1>
              <p>Across the Nightingale Floor is the first in a four part series written by Lian Hearn in 2002.</p>
              <p>The story is set in Feudal Japan, where a young boy is the only survivor or a raid on his village, he is taken in by a wandered and eventually raised as a ninja.</p>
              <p>Although the concept is a bit cliched, the focus of the book isn't on the story but on the self development and determination of the main character. He has to find and fight for his own morals and code of ethics while the whole world works against him.</p>
